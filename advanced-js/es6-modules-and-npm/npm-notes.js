// Short lil notes on npm

/*
npm is a package manager, it's a huge repository of plugins, libraries, and tools. npm provides us a command-line tool to install all of those things called "packages"
in our applications. 


npm revolvea around a file called package.json, the gist is that the file contains information such as dependencies and their versions and what npm does is read all of these and install
all of it and run any commands we've set as an npm script (which will be covered later).
